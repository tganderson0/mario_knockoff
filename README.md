# Mario Knockoff

This is just a simple Mario knockoff that I made in unity. This is mainly just so I can get some practice with C# and unity, in anticipation for classes I am going to be taking on game development and VR in Spring 2022.

This is a continuation of my C++ console renderer, as using Unity allows me to have nicer refresh rates. Currently, not much is completed on this, as this is a work in progess.

## Work so far

* Enemies detect walls and cliffs, and will turn around
* Player and enemies both can take damage, and player recieves a knockback stun effect if hit
* Camera follows player around, but only once player leaves the specified range

## Example
